          <p>You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. We have a fantastic little sky! The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play.</p>

          <p>Let's get crazy. Just make little strokes like that. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. Let's get crazy.</p>
          <p>If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. Let's get crazy. Just make little strokes like that. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. Let's get crazy.</p>
